# ByMC: Byzantine Model Checker

This is a toolset for parameterized model checking of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms. Check [README](./bymc/README.md) in the source directory.

The directory layout is as follows:

* ```bymc``` -- the scripts and tool source code
* ```plugins``` -- tool plugins

* ```legacy-bddc``` -- set of auxiliary scripts for model checking with NuSMV, needed only to run legacy techniques
* ```legacy-deps``` -- various dependencies required by the tools that are hard to install automatically, needed only to run legacy techniques
