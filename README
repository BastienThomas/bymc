ByMC: Byzantine Model Checker

This is a toolset for parameterized model checking of fault-tolerant
distributed algorithms.

The directory layout is as follows:

bymc -- the source code of the tool
bddc -- set of auxillary scripts for model checking with NuSMV
deps -- various dependencies required for the tools that are hard to install
        automatically

Please do not commit to the master branch.
