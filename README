# ByMC: Byzantine Model Checker #

This is a toolset for parameterized model checking of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms.

The directory layout is as follows:

* bymc -- the source code of the tool
* bddc -- set of auxillary scripts for model checking with NuSMV (needed only if you want to run legacy techniques)
* deps -- various dependencies required for the tools that are hard to install automatically  (needed only if you want to run legacy techniques)
