Version 2.4.2
 
 * fixing memory leaks

 * replacing the hashtable of fingerprints with a prefix tree

 * superincremental optimization

 * Allowing linear combinations in the left-hand side of a guard,
   e.g., a * x + b * y + c * z >= n - t + f. The coefficients a, b, ..., c
   should be either non-negative integers, or unknowns (for synthesis).
   The parameters can have both positive and negative coefficients.
   It is sound to use sums of shared variables in the guards.
   However, differences lead to undecidability. See CONCUR'18 for details.
